# Remote access
## STEP 1: Installing VScode
- First, you will need to download VScode at <https://code.visualstudio.com/> and follow the instructions.
- When it is installed, go to VScode and open a new window which should look something similar to this.

- You now have access to VS code!

## STEP 2: Remotely Connecting
- Next, in order to connect to a remote server, you will need to install git. Follow the instructions on <https://git-scm.com/downloads> to download git.
- Next, open a terminal in VScode by pressing on the Terminal dropdown and then pressing New Terminal.
- Once you have opened a new terminal, it should look something similar to this:

- After the $ character in the terminal, type in
  > **ssh cse15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu**
- The **"zz"** that you notice should be replaced with the letters in your specific course account. If this is your first time loging in, your terminal might look something similar to this
  > The authenticity of host 'ieng6-202.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.\
  > RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.\
  > Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?\
- Type 'yes' and hit enter. Then your terminal should now ask for a password which is the password for your specific course account. Once you enter your password, your terminal should now look something similar to this:
