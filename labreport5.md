# Lab Report 5
## Part 1 - Debug Scenario

    ![Image](Bash.png)
    - I am expecting to see the file ArrayTests to be graded by Junit but is instead saying that their is not a main method in the file ArrayTests. I am also expecting for the bash script to print out "File was found!" since the file exists but am getting an error saying that a specfic command in the bash script is not found.
- _**Detail the failure-inducing input and context**_
    - I have been compiling the bash script on the lab3 directory by running _**bash run.sh**_ which is the name of the bash script. I assume there might be something wrong in my if statanent in my bash script as the output says that the ArrayTests file exists but yet does not print "File was found!".

### Response From TA
